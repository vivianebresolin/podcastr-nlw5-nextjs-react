**Podcastr** is an application developed during the "Next Level Week #5", which is an intensive week, designed to help you take the next step in your evolution as a programmer. It is a free training provided by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).

This project was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
